You'll need to compile the scripts with g++. 
To execute any of the scripts simply run .\AdventOfCode1 or .\AdventOfCode2
you need minGW64 g++ compiler to actually run the pasta code.
A readable version was provided in the second cpp file
You can run your own results through the pasta code by replacing the sonarreading file or the values within the file. 
My results were 1226 and 1252.
